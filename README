##Blackjack Program 

#Skill Distillery exercise

This program is intended to allow the user to play blackjack against the computer and calculate whether the user wins or loses. 

In order to play, enter your name and select Y or N to start gameplay or exit. During gameplay, you will have the option to hit or stand depending on whether the win conditions have been met.

If win conditions are met, you win! If they are not, you can either bust or draw against the dealer.

So far this program has been really challenging because of all the moving parts. The OO interface has been beneficial in letting me see how all the pieces fit together, but when something breaks, it's hard to tell where and how to fix it.

As of 10/30, I have it working to the basic requirements.

My goals to continue are:

* Allow multiple players in the game (both computer and human)
* Implement a monetary system so players can place bets on their hands
* Allow players to split hands
* Allow players to double down
* Deal from a multi-deck shoe
* Separate the ace into values of 1 or 11 depending on the draw
