User Story #4

Implement the remaining rules of blackjack so you can determine a winner of each round.

Stretch Goals

Try as many of these as you like, but ONLY after you've completed, tested, and COMMITTED 
your working game that meets the requirements.

Allow multiple players in the game.

Implement a monetary system so players can place bets on their hands.

Allow players to split hands.

Allow players to double down.

Deal from a multi-deck shoe.

Keep going! How about implementing in-game suggestions based on the player's current hand? 
Maybe a card-counting player?

Grading

This is a graded project. You are expected to have your project completed by the start of 
class on Monday morning.

You will be given either a pass or fail based on whether your code works given all of the 
following test conditions:

Your program must NOT be contained in one procedural main(). You MUST design a OO class structure.

When the game begins both the player and dealer are dealt two cards.

If a player or dealer is dealt 21 the game is over. Otherwise the player can choose to hit or stay.

Once the player has completed their turn the dealer will begin their turn.

The game is immediately over if either player gets above 21.

To turn in a project, you must push it to GitHub. You must include a README.md that describes 
how to run your program. Include an overview of the class structure you chose to use.
